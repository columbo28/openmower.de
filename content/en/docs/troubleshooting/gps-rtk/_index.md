We assume that you at least followed [documentation of GPS setup]({{< relref "/docs/robot-assembly/prepare-the-parts/prepare-the-gps" >}}). If mower is already assembled - open the top cover.

Get your Windows PC and connect to GPS module directly with microUSB cable (as if you were uploading the configuration). 

Make sure that `Protocol of received messages` in bottom status bar right shows `UBX`, not `NMEA`. If not - upload configuration again. Then disconnect/connect power of GPS and make sure it stayed `UBX`.

Connect the antenna to the board and go outside to check if general GPS is working. If the mower is already assembled and an antenna is plugged in - just take it outside with the mower.
Even indoors next to the windows with antenna connected, you should see satellites and other info start appearing in u-center. In few minutes `GPS Fix` led will start blinking on GPS board.

Deviation map (`View->Deviation Map, F12`) should stay in a ~1m, that what you expect from average GPS. If you got some existing garbage there already, clean it via `File->Database clean`.

Now let's connect NTRIP. We assume that you either found a suitable [NTRIP node somewhere nearby](https://discord.com/channels/958476543846412329/980099128879108137/980100319700742145) (<30km) or running your own [base station]({{< relref "/docs/Knowledge-Base/rtk-base-setup" >}}).

Go to `Receiver->NTRIP Client...` and configure your NTRIP settings. This will be the same settings that you will use in [configuration file later]({{< relref "/docs/robot-assembly/prepare-the-parts/prepare-sd-card#openmowermower_configtxt-on-linux-bootopenmowermower_configtxt">}}).

NTRIP client should display green connection in the status bar. Deviation map (`View->Deviation Map, F12`) should stay dead center. `No RTK` led will start blinking or go away completely.

## Test GPS on Mainboard

We have checked that GPS works alone, let's see if it would together with mainboard. Plug GPS into mainboard. Everything should light up and start flashing. Wait until you are GREEN or RED/GREEN.

If you don't have dock station assembled and want to save the power in the main mower battery, you can power it from the Pico Dev board MicroUSB port, right below the GPS board. Use a 1A+ power bank, because computer USB port's 500mA might be not enough.

The openmower Web UI does not always display a good GPS symbol. The mounted GPS board transmits data to the openmower ros, where the position data will can be retriev
d by the openmower software.

In order to be able to debug the GPS state of your setup, you must connect to your OpenMower device via SSH and execute `./start_ros_bash.sh` which should take you to a bash shell inside of the docker process running on the raspberry pi.
Now you can execute `rostopic list` to list all exposed (available) topics in ros.

### Verify basic GPS(+RTK) status

To verify the position data from the GPS board, provided by your mower, just execute `rostopic echo -c -w 5 /xbot_driver_gps/xb_pose`:

```yaml
header:
  seq:   318
  frame_id: "gps"
orientation_valid: 0
motion_vector_valid: 1
position_accuracy: 0.021  # this is good
orientation_accuracy: 3.141
```

The values for "position_accuracy" must stay around 0.021, as this indicates that your GPS board is working and you have RTK packets received from your NTrip provider or base station.

Please remember, the accuracy is measured in 'meters'. A value of 0.021 translates to a position accuracy of '2.1cm'.

### Verify GPS distance status

The rover (your mower), takes the coordinates to measure the distance to it's base station.

In order to calculate the "distance" from your mower (rover) to the base station, we need to messure it.
The 'latitudes' and 'longitudes' coordinates describe the location of your "base station" and must be set in the /boot/openmower/mower_config.txt:

```ini

```

To verify that the position of the "base station" can be measured, execute `rostopic echo -c -w 5 /xbot_driver_gps/xb_pose`:

```yaml
```

Make sure that the values for "pose" do not display "NaN"! This is a bad sign, because the distance to the base station can not be measured.

### Verify the GPS flags

The openmower ros is using multiple flags to indicate the actual state of the given GPS accuracy.

To verify the actual flag provied by the openmower ros, you can execute `rostopic echo -c -w 5 /xbot_driver_gps/xb_pose`:

A flag of '3' means, that GPS signal from your rover is good and RTK is working.

You can use the following list of flags to understand the values:
